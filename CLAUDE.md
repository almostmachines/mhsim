# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- **Dev server:** `npm run dev` (Vite, serves at http://localhost:5173)
- **Build:** `npm run build` (runs `tsc -b && vite build`, output in `dist/`)
- **Lint:** `npm run lint` (ESLint)
- **Test:** `npm test` (bundles engine/state modules with esbuild into `tests/.tmp/`, then runs with Node's built-in test runner: `node --test tests/calculations.test.cjs`)

## Architecture

Interactive 3D visualization of Metropolis MCMC applied to Bayesian linear regression (slope, intercept, sigma). React + TypeScript + Vite, with react-three-fiber for 3D and Tailwind CSS v4.

### Layer separation

The codebase enforces a strict separation between pure computation and rendering:

- **`src/engine/`** — Pure math functions with zero React/DOM dependencies. `model.ts` computes log-likelihood/prior/posterior. `metropolis.ts` handles proposals, acceptance probability, and single MH steps. `random.ts` provides Box-Muller normal sampling. `data-generator.ts` creates synthetic observed data.
- **`src/state/`** — A `useReducer` state machine (`algorithm-state.ts`) drives the entire algorithm. The reducer is pure (except `Math.random()` calls in ACCEPT/AUTO_STEP). Phase transitions: `IDLE → PROPOSAL_SHOWN → RESULT_SHOWN → ... → COMPLETED`, with `AUTO_RUNNING` as a parallel auto-step mode.
- **`src/scene/`** — react-three-fiber components for 3D visualization. `scene-math.ts` normalizes parameter values to a 0–10 coordinate space via dynamic bounds computed from all samples. `PointCloud.tsx` uses `InstancedMesh` for performance.
- **`src/ui/`** — React control panel components (buttons, inputs, status, progress, results plot).
- **`src/config/sanitize.ts`** — Clamps and validates all user-provided config values before they reach the engine.

### Key types

`src/types.ts` defines `Params` (slope/intercept/sigma), `DataPoint`, `AlgorithmConfig`, and `DEFAULT_CONFIG`. `src/state/types.ts` defines `AlgorithmState`, `Phase`, and `AlgorithmAction`.

### Data flow

`App.tsx` holds `AlgorithmConfig` in `useState` and `AlgorithmState` in `useReducer`. Config changes auto-trigger a reset. The auto-step loop uses `requestAnimationFrame` with batches of 5 samples per frame. Config is sanitized at state initialization time, not on every dispatch.

## Testing

Tests are in `tests/calculations.test.cjs` (CommonJS). They test engine functions and reducer logic. The test pipeline bundles source files with esbuild before running since the source is ESM TypeScript. Add new test cases to the existing file following the `node:test` / `node:assert/strict` pattern.
